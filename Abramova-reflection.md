What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
   
 -   So far the I was only struggling time-wise, it takes me more time to process and understand new material then I expected it would) But I did resolve all challenges successfully ( yet =)).  

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

-  GitHub workflow became more clear ))

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

-   Could I save my credentials for a Hub in my terminal, so I don't need to type it in over and over every time
-   Should I merge to local master brunch before I push it to master in Hub

What still confuses you about Git?
    
   Can I merge/create pull request just for on directory/folder? (If I want o update just one folder in my repo and leave the rest files as it was?)

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

    I think it was pretty good for first time, although we did not really stick to the driver-navigator concept. Will do better on next one)
