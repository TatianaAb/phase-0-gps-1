Before the GPS I had never created a repo on github and was also struggling with merging branch's to the master branch and resolving merge conflicts. 

All of the above conflicts were definitely clarified during the GPS.

I asked my pair to help me with markdown. Or to help look up markdown while I would type. This was really helpful. I asked my guide a lot of questions such as why we use git push origin master, and what origin means and what master means. We also asked and learned what makes a good commit message, and a good git and github workflow. These were both really useful to go over too since what a went into a good commit message was still a little unclear to me.  

When and why to use git init is still a little bit confusing. 

I found parining in a GPS was really helpful in clarifying a lot of concepts that I was struggling with. It also was more fun working with a team on a project compared to working on a project by myself.
